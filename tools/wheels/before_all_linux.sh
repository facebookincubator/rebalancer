# Runs inside the manylinux_2_28_x86_64 container that cibuildwheel
# spawned for the matrix entry. Installs LLVM clang + lld, runs getdeps
# to produce librebalancer's transitive deps, and writes
# .cmake_prefix_path for the wheel-build cmake invocation to read via
# CMakeLists.txt (cibuildwheel's bashlex env-evaluator can't handle the
# redirects/||/&& we'd need to do this through CIBW_ENVIRONMENT).
