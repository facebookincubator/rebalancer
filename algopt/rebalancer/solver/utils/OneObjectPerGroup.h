/**
 * OneObjectPerGroup enforces that only one object from each group can be
 * selected from the source container when groups may overlap.
 *
 * This class tracks object counts per group in a partition where groups can
 * overlap (objects may belong to multiple groups) and ensures mutual
 * exclusion: an object can only be picked if all groups it belongs to are
 * untouched (have all their objects still in the source container).
 *
 * Key constraints and assumptions:
 * - The partition may have overlapping groups: an object can belong to
 *   multiple groups within the partition
 * - The class only tracks whether objects are in the source container or
 *   outside of it (binary state)
 * - Relies on LocalSearch invariants:
 *   * Only valid moves are performed between containers
 *   * No duplicate move operations are performed back-to-back
 *   * The class assumes these invariants hold and does not validate them
 *
 * Example Usage: GPU-Topology-Aware Adaptive Allotment
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Problem: Servers have multiple server parts that share physical GPUs.
 * When allocating parts from "unassigned", we want to ensure only one part
 * per server is picked at a time to avoid GPU conflicts. A single overlapping
 * partition groups server parts by server, where parts may appear in multiple
 * groups due to shared GPU resources.
 *
 *   // Setup tracker with single overlapping partition name
 *   auto tracker = std::make_shared<OneObjectPerGroup>(
 *       universe, "server_gpu_topology", unassignedContainer,
 * initialAssignment); attributeStore.registerAttributes("gpu_topology",
 * tracker);
 *
 *   // When selecting candidates from "unassigned" for allocation:
 *   for (auto candidatePart : unassignedParts) {
 *     if (tracker->canPick(candidatePart)) {
 *       // Safe to allocate: no other part from same server using shared GPU
 *       // has been picked yet
 *       candidateMove.insert(candidatePart);
 *     }
 *   }
