# Group Count

**Type**: [Goal or Constraint](#goal-vs-constraint)

Limit how many objects of the same group land in the same scope item. For example,
keep at most 3 tasks of any one job on the same host, so a single host failure
takes down only part of each job.

## Example

An example use: keep at most 3 tasks of the same job on the same host. There are 2
hosts and 9 tasks, partitioned into 2 jobs---`task0`-`task4` are `job0`,
`task5`-`task8` are `job1`. Initially all of `job0` is on `host0` (5 tasks) and
all of `job1` is on `host1` (4 tasks):

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/reference/group-count/initial-assignment.png')} alt="Initial assignment: job0 (5 tasks) on host0, job1 (4 tasks) on host1" />

With a global limit of 3, Rebalancer moves 2 tasks of `job0` from `host0` to
`host1`, and 1 task of `job1` from `host1` to `host0`.

```cpp
solver.setObjectName("task");
solver.setContainerName("host");

solver.setAssignment(std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>{
    {"host0", {"task0", "task1", "task2", "task3", "task4"}},
    {"host1", {"task5", "task6", "task7", "task8"}},
});

// Let Rebalancer know which job each task belongs to.
solver.addPartition(
    "job",
    std::map<std::string, std::string>{
        {"task0", "job0"}, {"task1", "job0"}, {"task2", "job0"},
        {"task3", "job0"}, {"task4", "job0"}, {"task5", "job1"},
        {"task6", "job1"}, {"task7", "job1"}, {"task8", "job1"}});

// At most 3 tasks of the same job per host (counts objects by default).
GroupCountSpec groupCount;
groupCount.scope() = "host";
groupCount.partitionName() = "job";

Limit limit;
limit.type() = LimitType::ABSOLUTE;
limit.globalLimit() = 3;
groupCount.limit() = limit;

solver.addConstraint(groupCount);
```

The resulting assignment---each host now holds at most 3 tasks of any one job:

See [more examples](#examples) below for relative limits, per-scope-item and
per-group limits, minimum bounds, and the squares objective.

## Goal vs. constraint

**As a constraint**, the limit is enforced. If the initial assignment already
satisfies it for a (group, scope item) pair, the final assignment is guaranteed to
satisfy it too. If the initial assignment *breaks* it, the general
[constraint policy](../constraint-policy) applies: under the default policy an
initially-broken pair becomes a high-priority goal to fix, while "do not make it
worse" stays a hard constraint.

**As a goal**, the spec's value is proportional to the total count exceeded beyond
the limit, summed over every (group, scope item) pair.

## Bound

The `bound` selects how the limit is interpreted:

| Bound | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `MAX` (default) | At most `limit` objects of a group per scope item |
| `MIN` | At least `limit` objects of a group per scope item |
| `EXACT` | Exactly `limit` objects of a group per scope item |
| `MULTIPLE` | The count must be an integer multiple of `limit` |

A `MIN` bound forbids a (group, scope item) pair from being empty. When the
desired behavior is "either empty, or at least the limit", set `zeroAllowed` to
`true`. See [Example 9](#example-9) below.

:::caution `EXACT` and `MULTIPLE` need the optimal solver
`EXACT` (and `MULTIPLE`) work poorly with the local-search solver: it improves the
assignment through small incremental moves, but satisfying an exact/multiple bound
usually requires a coordinated set of moves at once, so most single moves fail and
the search stalls. Use the [optimal (MIP) solver](../../solvers/overview) for these
bounds.
:::

## Limit

The `limit` is a [`Limit`](../common/limit). A limit applies to each (group,
scope item) pair, and there are several ways to specify it; pairs not covered fall
back to `globalLimit`:

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `globalLimit` | One limit for all pairs (and the fallback for the maps below) |
| `scopeItemLimits` | A limit per scope item, shared by all groups there ([Example 3](#example-3)) |
| `groupLimits` | A limit per group, shared across all scope items ([Example 5](#example-5)) |
| `scopeItemToGroupLimits` | A limit per (scope item, group) combination ([Example 7](#example-7)) |

The `type` field chooses how each number is read:

- `ABSOLUTE` --- a raw count (or, with a `dimension`, a raw summed quantity). A
  global limit of 3 means at most 3 objects of a group per scope item
  (the [example above](#example)).
- `RELATIVE` --- a proportion. A limit of `0.7` means at most 70% of a group may
  land on one scope item ([Example 2](#example-2)).

By default a relative limit is measured against the **group's size**
(`limitRelativeTo = GROUP_SIZE`). Set `limitRelativeTo = SCOPE_ITEM_UTIL` to make
it a proportion of the scope item's own utilization instead---e.g. "no group may
account for more than 50% of a host's utilization" ([Example 11](#example-11)).

## Squares

Only relevant when used as a goal. With `squares = true`, each pair's excess above
the limit is squared before summing, so larger overflows are penalized
disproportionately---use it to even out the excess across pairs. For two solutions
where pair A exceeds by 10 and B by 0, versus A by 5 and B by 5, the plain goal
scores both `10`, but with squares the second (`5² + 5² = 50`) beats the first
(`10² = 100`).

A common idiom is a "balance" objective: set the limit to `0` with `squares`
enabled to minimize the sum of squared per-(group, scope item) counts, spreading
each group as evenly as possible ([Example 10](#example-10)).

:::note
`squares` is not supported by the optimal (MIP) solver. If you need it there, model
each group with a separate dimension and a [Balance](balance) goal.
:::

## Definition

The `definition` controls *which* objects are counted toward a scope item. The
default, `AFTER`, counts an object in its destination scope item in the final
assignment---the natural choice. The others additionally count objects in flight,
which helps when moves are not instantaneous in the system being modeled.

| Definition | Counts |
|------------|--------|
| `AFTER` (default) | An object only in its destination scope item |
| `DURING` | An object in both its source and destination (double-counted while moving) |
| `DURING_AND_AFTER` | The sum of `DURING` and `AFTER` |
| `STAYED` | Only objects that did not move |

See [Utilization definitions](../common/utilization-definitions) for a detailed
explanation with diagrams (GroupCount shares the core `AFTER`/`DURING`/
`DURING_AND_AFTER` notions).

## Filter

The `filter` ([`Filter`](../common/filter)) selects which scope items the spec
applies to: set `itemsWhitelist` (consider only these) or `itemsBlacklist`
(consider all but these). For example, to apply the limit to `host0` only:

```cpp
GroupCountSpec groupCount;
groupCount.scope() = "host";
groupCount.partitionName() = "job";

Limit limit;
limit.type() = LimitType::ABSOLUTE;
limit.globalLimit() = 3;
groupCount.limit() = limit;

// Apply the limit to host0 only (use itemsBlacklist to exclude instead).
groupCount.filter()->itemsWhitelist() = {"host0"};

solver.addConstraint(groupCount);
```

## More Examples {#examples}

All examples below start from the same setup as the [example above](#example): 2
hosts and 9 tasks, with `job0` (5 tasks) on `host0` and `job1` (4 tasks) on
`host1`. Each links to its runnable unit test.

### Example 2: global relative limit {#example-2}

At most 70% of a job's tasks on one host. Rebalancer moves 2 tasks of `job0` from
`host0` to `host1`, and 2 tasks of `job1` from `host1` to `host0`.

### Example 3: per-scope-item absolute limit {#example-3}

`host0` accepts up to 3 tasks of the same job; any other host up to 5 (the global
limit). Rebalancer moves 2 tasks of `job0` off `host0`; `job1` is left untouched.

### Example 4: per-scope-item relative limit {#example-4}

`host1` accepts at most 50% of a job's tasks; any other host up to 100%.
Rebalancer moves half of `job1`'s tasks from `host1` to `host0`.

### Example 5: per-group absolute limit {#example-5}

`job1` may place at most 3 of its tasks on the same host; any other job up to 4.
Rebalancer moves 1 task of `job0` and 1 task of `job1`.

### Example 6: per-group relative limit {#example-6}

`job0` may place up to 60% of its tasks on one host, `job1` up to 50%. Rebalancer
moves 2 tasks of `job0` and 2 tasks of `job1`.

### Example 7: per-(scope-item, group) absolute limit {#example-7}

`job0` may place up to 2 tasks on `host0` and up to 4 on `host1`; `job1` up to 1
on `host0`; any other combination up to 5. Rebalancer moves 3 tasks of `job0`
from `host0` to `host1`; `job1` has no incentive to move.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/reference/group-count/example-7.png')} alt="Per-scope-item-and-group absolute limit solution" />

### Example 8: per-(scope-item, group) relative limit {#example-8}

`job0` may place up to 50% of its tasks on `host0`; any other job up to 80% on any
host. Rebalancer moves 3 tasks of `job0` off `host0` and 1 task of `job1` off
`host1`.

### Example 9: min bound {#example-9}

A `MIN` bound with a limit of 1: each job must place at least 1 task on every host.
Rebalancer moves 1 task of `job0` to `host1` and 1 task of `job1` to `host0`.
([source](https://github.com/facebook/rebalancer/blob/main/algopt/rebalancer/interface/tests/GroupCountTest.cpp#L711-L746))

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/reference/group-count/example-9.png')} alt="Min bound solution" />

### Example 10: squares objective {#example-10}

Used as a goal with limit 0 and `squares` enabled---a balance objective that
spreads each job evenly. Rebalancer moves 2 tasks of `job0` and 2 tasks of `job1`.
([source](https://github.com/facebook/rebalancer/blob/main/algopt/rebalancer/interface/tests/GroupCountTest.cpp#L794-L835))

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/reference/group-count/example-10.png')} alt="Squares objective solution" />

### Example 11: limit relative to scope-item utilization {#example-11}

With `limitRelativeTo = SCOPE_ITEM_UTIL`, `job0` may not account for more than 50%
of `host0`'s utilization (plus a `MIN` capacity constraint so `host0` is not simply
emptied). The result leaves `host0` with 2 tasks, one from each job.
